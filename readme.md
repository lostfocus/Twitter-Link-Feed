# Twitter Link Feed v6

This script is a really simple way to get a feed of all links from the tweets in your timeline.

## Installation

* Just download the whole thing, put it somewhere on your web server. The access from the outside should only be to the `htdocs` directory, obviously. 
* Create a new Twitter application at [dev.twitter.com/apps/new](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new)
* Copy the the `example.config.php` file to `config.php` and put the OAuth stuff from Twitter in it.
* Point your browser to `feed.php` and subscribe to it in your favorite feedreader.
